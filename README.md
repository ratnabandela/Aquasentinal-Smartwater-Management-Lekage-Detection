#Aquasentinel: Smart Water Management and Leakage Detection
To Save and Conserve Water(ByteVerse Hackathon Project)

Research shows that worldwide, freshwater resources are rapidly diminishing, causing tension among different nations. 
The primary reasons for this crisis are 
uneven distribution of the water resources around the globe, 
rapid growth in urbanization, 
drastic increase in industrial activities, and 
a lack of awareness about water consumption
Water is usually stored in the overhead or underground tanks. In addition, larger organizations (e.g., universities, factories, and malls) also fill tanks from their private tube wells. 
The use of tube wells and over-pumping water from the underground resources lead to decreasing levels of fresh water, water pollution, and increased overall expenses associated with deeper drilling and pumping out of water.
Given the overall challenges in the fresh water supply crisis, preventing water wastage seems not only prudent but necessary.

Our Idea acomplishes the project by:
1) Automatic monitoring of water levels in tanks
2) Automatic detection of water leakage from tanks and supply pipes in the proximity
3) Automated tanks refilling while avoiding the dry run of motors or pumps.
